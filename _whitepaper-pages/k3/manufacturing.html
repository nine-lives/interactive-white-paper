            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you manage a global network of partners and customers?</div>
            <p>
                With a distribution centre in one country, headquarters in another, and customers in a third, traditional means of communication aren’t enough to keep everyone connected. You need to be able to monitor and balance the interactions between these different entities, and that means having complete real-time visibility into how your business is operating.

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Do you know enough about your evolving market?</div>
            <p>
                Thanks to technology, new markets are opening up in more regions than ever before. To compete, you're up against local companies who have in-depth market knowledge and lower costs. Being located within the market means they have greater visibility and the agility to react quickly to local needs. Again, visibility through detailed data is key to competing.

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInLeft">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you reduce risk by ensuring regulatory compliance? </div>
            <p>
                The list of regulatory requirements is huge and constantly growing. You need to understand the many different compliance standards and frameworks, and also prove your compliance via instant, real-time reporting. As Brexit threatens to unhinge existing EU regulation, your business needs the flexibility to keep up with the changes.
            </p>

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Do you have the insights you need to predict demand?</div>
            <p>
                Distributors need to ensure that all business resources and operations are optimally aligned with demand. The single most important initiative for distributors is to provide organisation-wide access to information that lets managers and supply chain partners make fast, strategic decisions. Deeper market intelligence is of course vital to achieving this objective.

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInLeft">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you optimise continuously?</div>
            <p>
                Some of distributions’ biggest challenges include tracking and fulfilling orders, managing receivables and inventory management. You need to be able to optimise storage, streamline the movement of goods, and effectively plan transportation in order to make warehouses as efficient as possible. Do you have the insights to do this?

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Are you employing technology to stay ahead?</div>
            <p>
                This is no time to be letting legacy systems hold you back. You need to replace what isn't pushing your business forward with modern, enterprise management solutions that are easy to use and can support you through the challenges that have developed over the last decade.
