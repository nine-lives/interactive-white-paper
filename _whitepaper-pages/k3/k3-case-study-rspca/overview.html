            As organisations grow, they can easily find that the finance and ERP systems they started out with begin to slow them down. Analysing data and handling information becomes laborious and inefficient, potentially putting a brake on performance and growth. For the vehicle safety, security and repair experts at Thatcham Research, this was the right moment to shift up a gear—and switch to Sage’s enterprise management solution.

            Thatcham Research was established nearly 50 years ago by a group of motor insurance businesses. Its mission was to help these firms control the cost of their claims. Thatcham Research’s primary focus was therefore on improving vehicle safety, making post-accident repairs more efficient and reliable, and strengthening vehicle security. Their remit has since evolved into being a recognised authority speaking on behalf of the motor insurance industry, involved in virtually everything to do with the safety, security and repair of vehicles.
