            <i>“We were one of the very early adopters of enterprise management”, Butterfield continues, “probably one of the first five that K3 had implemented within the UK and I suspect that may well have been true of Sage themselves as well. As a result, we had a great deal of support from K3 and Sage alike. We also put the highest priority on the project ourselves. When organisations implement new initiatives like this, you can often predict the eventual level of success by the degree of effort and commitment they put into it. Thatcham Research actively seconded personnel to concentrate on the deployment of enterprise management and I was brought in from outside the organisation to really ensure a focus on its success. Thatcham took it seriously, K3 took it seriously, and Sage themselves took it seriously too. It was the right approach and as a result the deployment came in under budget and hit the milestones we set ourselves.”   </i> WHO??

            Thatcham Research predominantly use the Finance module within enterprise management because they wanted to streamline the whole of that business process from recording through to reporting, and gain a clearer insight into the costings and commercial performance of their diverse range of activities.

<p class=""pb-3">As Ian Butterfield describes it:</p>
        <p class="quote-color pb-3"><b> <i>“Much of the success we’ve had has been on the Financials side because we’ve been able to say to the business: We’ve made it easier for you to place an order, approve the order, get the goods in, get an invoice, match it and pay it. Sage Business Cloud Enterprise Management works very well for all of those basic yet essential actions.”</i>
