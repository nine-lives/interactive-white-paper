            When it comes to the wider business benefits of the switch to enterprise management, Butterfield identifies two in particular:
        </p>
        <p class="quote-color pb-3"><b>
            <i>“The first was that switching to enterprise management gave us a blank sheet of paper. So we were able to do a degree of database cleansing that we would not have had an opportunity to do had we not put in a new system. The old system had grown in a way that veered out of control. There were customers on there that we no longer dealt with, or hadn’t dealt with for a very long time. Transactions, analysis and reports had been added without any planning or organisation. A good exercise in basic housekeeping was well overdue and the new system provided the perfect prompt for getting on with the job.” </i>

            The second big win was that Sage Business Cloud Enterprise Management allowed Thatcham Research to gain maximum benefit from the straightforward but robust processes it already had in place, making it possible to achieve the right balance between encouraging individual initiative and maintaining organisational control.

        <p class="pb-3">
            Such improvements are indicative of a new efficiency in the way Thatcham Research now manages its Financials—an efficiency which translates into measurable cost savings thanks to a significant reduction in rework, as Ian Butterfield concludes:
        </p>
        <p class="quote-color pb-3"><b>
            <i>“I can tell you that under the old system one of our teams had two full time employees who worked flat-out making sure a particular process was carried out. At the time Sage was deployed we were thinking that additional part-time cover would be required as well. With enterprise management in place, that part time person wasn’t required and one of those FTEs is now only required four days rather than five days per week. That’s a real saving for the business, and it’s certainly not an isolated example.”</i>
