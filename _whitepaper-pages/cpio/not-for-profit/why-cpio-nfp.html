            <em>“We liked the fact that there were options as to how we wanted to manage our business in Enterprise
                Management (formerly Sage X3). This gave us the conﬁdence that we could grow into the system and
                develop it as our business changed. By selecting Sage, we felt that we were “future prooﬁng” our
                investment.” </em>
