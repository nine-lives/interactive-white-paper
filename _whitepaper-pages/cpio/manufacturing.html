            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you manage a global network of partners and suppliers?</div>
            <p>
                Even if your market is local, your supply chains and service providers could well be
                located all over the world. You need to be able to monitor and balance the interactions
                between these different factors, and that means having complete real-time visibility
                into how your business is operating.

            <div class="ui tiny header">Do you have the insights you need to innovate?</div>
            <p>
                Throughout history, manufacturing developments have taken the form of creative new
                solutions to old problems. But many of today’s most successful innovations are
                meeting market needs in ever more specific ways, honing and improving the old
                solutions. Deeper market intelligence is of course vital to achieving this objective.

            <div class="ui tiny header">Do you know enough about your evolving market?</div>
            <p>
                Thanks to technology, new markets are opening up in more regions than ever before.
                To compete you’re up against local companies who have in-depth market knowledge
                and lower costs. Being located within the market means they have greater visibility
                and the agility to react quickly to local needs. Again, visibility through detailed data is
                key to competing.

        <div class="column animated-hidden-start delay-4s" data-animation="fadeIn">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you optimise continuously?</div>
            <p>
                As parts are increasingly sourced from different suppliers and products are built in
                different locales, consistency becomes more essential than ever. You need to assure
                the quality, safety, and efficacy of your products at all times, yet deliver the flexibility
                to generate the most from every commercial opportunity. Do you have the insights to
                do this?

        <div class="column animated-hidden-start delay-5s" data-animation="fadeIn">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you reduce risk by ensuring regulatory compliance?</div>
            <p>
                The list of regulatory requirements is huge and constantly growing. You need to
                understand the many different compliance standards and frameworks, and also prove
                your compliance via instant, real-time reporting. As Brexit threatens to unhinge
                existing EU regulation, your business needs the flexibility to keep up with the changes.

        <div class="column animated-hidden-start delay-6s" data-animation="fadeIn">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Are you employing technology to stay ahead?</div>
            <p>
                This is no time to be letting legacy systems hold you back. You need to replace what
                isn't pushing your business forward with modern enterprise management solutions
                that are easy to use and can support you through the challenges that have developed
                over the last decade.
