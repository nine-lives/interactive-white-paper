            <i>“We needed a solution that would enable us to take control of the business, and maximise our donations,
            so that they are focused on animal welfare and not administration costs. We also wanted
            a solution that had longevity. We’re very aware, sadly, that the need for our services is not going away
                any time soon.”</i> - Helen Tracey, Chief Financial Officer for RSPCA

            RSPCA wanted a plug-and-play solution, and it had to support best practices.  They wanted a solution which fitted in with their 'digital first' approach; a cloud-based solution which meant they didn't have to heavily invest in IT infrastructure.
