            “We needed a solution that would enable us to take control of the business, and maximise our donations,
            so that they are focused on animal welfare and not to administration costs,” Helen said. “We also wanted
            a solution that had longevity. We’re very aware, sadly, that the need for our services is not going away
            any time soon.”

            “We wanted a plug-and-play solution, not bespoke—we wanted to configure, not customise—and it had to
            support best practices. We also wanted a cloud-based solution. As well as fitting in with our
            Organisation’s ‘digital first’ approach, a cloud solution meant we don’t have to heavily invest in IT
            infrastructure,” Helen said. “Instead, we have put that money towards helping animals,” she added.
