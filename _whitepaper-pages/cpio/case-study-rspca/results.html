            Phase one was delivered on time and within budget and the benefits have quickly spread
            across the business.

            <i>“We estimate we’ve already seen a 20%-40% increase in efficiency by moving from a
                traditional system of paper invoices and old-fashioned date stamps to scanned invoices,”</i>
            <br> Helen Tracey, Chief Financial Officer for RSPCA.

            There’s universal
            love for the new system across the business. With Enterprise Management available on any device, people can
            now take business data to where it’s most needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-purple text-larger pb-3"><b>
            <i>“Our commercial colleagues do a lot of work supporting
                teams in the regions. Previously they were more desk based and took wads of paper with them when they
                did go
                to site. Now they can go any time and take Sage with them – on their laptop, Chromebook or mobile
                phone,”</i> Helen said.

        <p class="pb-3">
            The quicker and easier data analysis in Enterprise Management also helps the commercial team to
            generate better forward-looking planning.

            Another key aim of the new system was faster financial closing, particularly at year end.

            <i> “We wanted to shift the balance of work to earlier in the process, to make sure we have the data insight
                earlier in the
                system,”</i> Helen said. <i>“And it’s been a success – the timetable and schedules are better. Even the
            auditors
            have seen a real difference: we have better data insight and can respond with much greater agility to their
            requests for information,”</i> Helen said.</b></p>
        <p class="pb-3">
            Fewer invoices and less paper has reduced the finance teams’
            workloads and admin costs, but Helen says the Society has also seen some unexpected benefits. </p>
        <p class="text-purple text-larger pb-3"><b><i>“We’ve found
        we now have a more consistent approach to processes across the team, which allows for more flexible
            working,”</i> Helen said. <i>“People are collaborating much more, and we can now achieve a clear desk policy. It
            gives us more space and makes the office a nicer place to work.”</i></b>
