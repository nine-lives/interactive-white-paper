            The UK’s leading animal welfare charity

            deliver a flexible, future-proof business
            management system.

            Phase one went live in July 2017, delivered on time and within budget, and the benefits have quickly spread across the business. “We estimate we’ve already seen a 20%-40% increase in efficiency by moving from a traditional system of paper invoices and old-fashioned date stamps to scanned invoices,” Helen said. “We’re still calculating the reductions we’re seeing in cost per transaction, but that, plus the amount of rework, are two of our key metrics, and we can already see both values coming down,” she added. There’s universal love for the new system across the business. With Enterprise Management available on any device, people can now take business data to where it’s most needed. “Our commercial colleagues do a lot of work supporting teams in the regions. Previously they were more desk based and took wads of paper with them when they did go to site. Now they can go any time and take Sage with them – on their laptop, Chromebook or mobile phone,” Helen said. The quicker and easier data analysis in Enterprise Management also helps the commercial team to generate better forward-looking planning.

            Another key aim of the new system was faster financial closing, particularly at year end. “We wanted to shift the balance of work to earlier in the process, to make sure we have the data insight earlier in the system,” Helen said. “And it’s been a success – the timetable and schedules are better. Even the auditors have seen a real difference: we have better data insight and can respond with much greater agility to their requests for information,” Helen said. Fewer invoices and less paper has reduced the finance teams’ workloads and admin costs, but Helen says the Society has also seen some unexpected benefits. “We’ve found we now have a more consistent approach to processes across the team, which allows for more flexible working,” she said. “People are collaborating much more, and we can now achieve a clear desk policy. It gives us more space and makes the office a nicer place to work.”
