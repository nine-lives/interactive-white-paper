            Founded nearly 200 years ago, in 1824, the RSPCA is now one of the UK’s largest
            charities, with an income of £140M and over 1,600 employees.

        <p class="pb-3">
            Many of our processes, particularly in finance, had become outdated. Like many older charities, processes had evolved by default, not design, and there was a gap between what we were doing and current best practices. We also knew we needed to have greater clarity and leverage over our information. By shifting the finance team away from transactional processing to a review and analysis-type role, we knew we could really add value to the business.
