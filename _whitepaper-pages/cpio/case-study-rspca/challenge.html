            Many of their processes, particularly in finance, had become outdated. Like many older charities, processes had evolved by default, not design, and there was a gap between what they were doing and current best practices. They also knew they needed to have greater clarity and leverage over information. By shifting the finance team away from transactional processing to a review and analysis-type role, they could really add value to the business.
