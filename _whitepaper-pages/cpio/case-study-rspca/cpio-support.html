            <i>“The role of CPiO was again invaluable here. Following their lead, we created a collaborative project team made up of technical/business project managers and subject matter experts, who all worked together to make sure we got the right results.”</i> Helen Tracey, Chief Financial Officer for RSPCA</b>

    <p class="pb-3""><b>
        A critical element was the role that CPiO played. CPiO really understood the organisational goals and aims for the system. They worked, and continue to work, very positively with RSPCA.  CPiO are excellent at challenging some of its established processes – questioning the methods, so that they could get the most out of a modern enterprise management solution.
