            Introducing Sage software gives RSPCAâ€™s central teams the opportunity to do more for others, such as fulfill a more service-led function to the large branch network. In corporate and social responsibility (CSR) terms, RSPCA could start to assist other smaller charities, particularly those working in the same arena. Improving processes and reducing admin frees people up to do all this, and more.

            In addition to the core financial management modules for invoicing, payments and the usual checks and balances, the RSPCA chose to implement two additional modules. Sage Enterprise Intelligence gives intuitive real-time data reporting that makes it quick and easy to get relevant business insights (and ensures a consistent data view for everyone). And with eDocument Management, an electronic copy of an invoice can now be stored with a transaction, keeping everything together and removing the need for paper copies.
