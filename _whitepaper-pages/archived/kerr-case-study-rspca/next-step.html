            Looking ahead, these relationships look set to strengthen. Thatcham Research is currently working with K3 on
            upgrading to a web-based package which will make the solution much more accessible for users throughout the
            organisation who may not have a background in accountancy. Building on this upgrade, Thatcham Research will
            also have an even easier route for widespread adoption of the other modules within Enterprise Management as
            the need arises, driving the organisation towards even greater success in the future.
