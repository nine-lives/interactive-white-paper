                    In traditional B2B marketing, there is often a clear handshake between
                    marketing leads and Sales. Sometimes, responsibility for nurturing leads
                    is left unclaimed. In ABM, there is no clear handover â€“ leads are treated
                    individually and Sales and Marketing must align to a) make sure the
                    messages being delivered are relevant to their stage, and b) agree at what
                    point Sales takes on the lead to develop to purchase.

                    This is a shared responsibility and a process that is both rare and valuable
                    to foster in organisations with long sales cycles and multiple decision
                    makers.
