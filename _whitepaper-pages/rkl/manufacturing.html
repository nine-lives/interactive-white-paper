            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you reduce risk by ensuring regulatory compliance?</div>
            <p>
                Food and beverage organizations face more regulatory pressure every day and the Food Safety Modernization Act places new responsibilities on every food and beverage producer and distributor. You need traceability tools to allow you to handle expiration management, sustainability, allergen tracking, recalls and more in a streamlined and integrated way so you can demonstrate compliance whilst focussing on growing your business.

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Do you have the insights you need to predict demand?</div>
            <p>
                There is more uncertainty within the food and beverage industry than in almost any other. Whilst you can’t predict some of these uncertainties such as crop failure and extreme weather, improved forecasting, real-time visibility and an integrated system can help you prepare and respond to market changes reducing inefficiencies and waste and ultimately save you money.

            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you manage a global network of partners and customers?</div>
            <p>
                With a distribution center in one country, headquarters in another, and customers in a third, traditional means of communication aren’t enough to keep everyone connected. You need to be able to monitor and balance the interactions between these different entities, and that means having complete real-time visibility into how your business is operating.

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Are your quality control and assurance processes fully integrated?</div>
            <p>
                For food and beverage manufacturers, quality control is a never-ending process that is both time consuming and costly. Using legacy systems or a myriad of spreadsheets to track formulas, maintain batch information or monitor lots across the production change is inefficient. Your customers demand consistent quality or your reputation could be at stake. You need an integrated business system designed to support process manufacturing that can help you meet today’s quality control requirements.

            <div class="ui tiny header">Can you optimise continuously?</div>
            <p>
                Managing and growing your business whilst keeping abreast of ever changing regulatory and compliance requirements is challenging. You need your data to support your manufacturing processes, automate compliance reporting and improve integration and efficiency across your organization. Do you have the insights to achieve this?

        <div class="column delay-200s" data-animation="slideInRight">
            <div class="ui tiny header">Are you employing technology to stay ahead?</div>
            <p>
                This is no time to be letting legacy systems hold you back. You need to replace what isn't pushing your business forward with modern, enterprise management solutions that are easy to use and can support you through the challenges that have developed over the last decade and position you for the future.
