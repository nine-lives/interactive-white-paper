        <p class="pb-3"><b>Overview</b><br>
            Stewart & Jasper Orchards (S&J) has been a family run business for over 60 years. S&J has expanded over the
            years to become a leader in hulling, shelling, processing, exporting and marketing almonds through both
            wholesale and retail channels.
        </p>

               <p class="pb-3"><b>The Challenge</b><br>
            Stewart & Jasper were looking for ways to improve the efficiency of their business and streamline operations
            from managing ingredient usage and production costs to integrating their retail offering. They also needed a
            way to protect their brand by ensuring every customer enjoys the same quality from every purchase.

        <p class="pb-3"><b>The Solution</b><br>Stewart & Jasper turned to RKL eSolutions to advise on the appropriate solution to meet their
            needs. Sage Business Cloud Enterprise Management offered the functionality and tools they required to
            address the challenges they had identified.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">
            In addition to hauling, shelling and processing almonds, S&J produces gift baskets. Enterprise Management
            helped integrate their retail operations allowing their POS system to send data directly into the Sage ERP
            solution, helping to streamline business operations.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-3">As a process manufacturer using Enterprise Management, S&J utilizes recipes to manage
            ingredient usage and production costs. Recipes are used to track the quantity requirements and costs of
            individual items, such as bulk almonds, flavorings, and sugar per batch and lot. Enterprise Management also
            gave S&J the ability to forecast ingredient requirements and production planning for each final product to
            meet its growing demand.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">Using lot tracking functionality within Enterprise Management, S&J can now track the shelf life
            for each product and also be better prepared should there a product recall occur. Both combining to ensure a
            consistent customer experience.</p>
