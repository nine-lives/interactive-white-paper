        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="plan" description="A strategic plan to grow Channel is important if long-term growth is a priority. This plan needs to look at realistic objectives and how these can be achieved through current Partners or whether there is a requirement for further partner recruitment." %}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="resource" description="Vendors who work entirely through master agents or distibutors often have limited control, visibility, accessibility and potential ROI as they do not own the Channel realtionships and are competing for share of voice. Making Channel successful is resource heavy and needs a dedicated Channel team and budget in order to service and grow effectively."%}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="recruit" description="An open-door policy to Partner recruitment can work for certain product types but the result can be a long tail of Partners who are rarely active. The key is to ensure that Partners are as self-sufficient as possible to deliver value and limit impact on vendor resource. A highly structured onboarding programme is key to getting Partners trained and transactional efficiently."%}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="enable" description="Effective enablement of new Partners starts with a clear on-boarding programme where Partners can quickly understand the product, resources available to them, key differentiators and a clear message to take to market. On-going enablement should focus on ensuring Partners are kept up-to-date about product, Vendor objectives and market insight. A structured approach of ongoing contact, performance reviews and encouraging Partner feedback should be partly automated and partly direct for limited Channel resource to stretch as far as possible."%}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="engage" description="Creating a Channel culture which encourages close Vendor/Partner relations is more likely to deliver long-term success for both parties. This should include regular outreach to Partners and clear communication of expectations. Channel success relies on trusted, committed Partnerships  - and these can only be established if there is open communication based on vendor support and partner feedback." %}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="grow" description="Building robust managed programmes which engage Partners are an important element in increasing visibility and ROI across your Channel. A mixture of strategic and tactical programmes will deliver both short and long term revenue. Incentivising partners and providing the tools and support to encourage self-sufficiency, will solidify relationships and provide a road map for future growth."%}
        {% include channel-growth-model/pillar-result.html pillar="measure" description="Understanding how engaged and motivated your partners are and in turn, the value they are delivering is key to scaling your Channel. By implementing the right platforms to develop KPIs, track partner performance, deal registrations and plan and audit MDF, vendors are able to effectively measure channel performance and develop strategies for future growth."%}
