                        Food and beverage organizations face more regulatory pressure every day and the Food Safety
                        Modernization Act places new responsibilities on every food and beverage producer and distributor. You
                        need traceability tools to allow you to handle expiration management, sustainability, allergen tracking,
                        recalls and more in a streamlined and integrated way so you can demonstrate compliance while focussing
                        on growing your business.

                    <p>
                        There is more uncertainty within the food and beverage industry than in almost any other. While you
                        can’t predict some of these uncertainties such as crop failure and extreme weather, improved
                        forecasting, real-time visibility and an integrated system can help you prepare and respond to market
                        changes reducing inefficiencies and waste and ultimately save you money.

                        With a distribution center in one country, headquarters in another, and customers in a third,
                        traditional means of communication aren’t enough to keep everyone connected. You need to be able to
                        monitor and balance the interactions between these different entities, and that means having complete
                        real-time visibility into how your business is operating.

                    <p>
                        For food and beverage manufacturers, quality control is a never-ending process that is both time
                        consuming and costly. Using legacy systems or a myriad of spreadsheets to track formulas, maintain batch
                        information or monitor lots across the production change is inefficient. Your customers demand
                        consistent quality or your reputation could be at stake. You need an integrated business system designed
                        to support process manufacturing that can help you meet today’s quality control requirements.

                        requirements is challenging. You need your data to support your manufacturing processes, automate
                        compliance reporting and improve integration and efficiency across your organization. Do you have the

                <p class="pb-3"><b>Overview</b><br>
                    Stewart & Jasper Orchards (S&J) has been a family run business for over 60 years. S&J has expanded over the
                    years to become a leader in hulling, shelling, processing, exporting and marketing almonds through both
                    wholesale and retail channels.
                </p>

                <p class="pb-3"><b>The Challenge</b><br>
                    Stewart & Jasper were looking for ways to improve the efficiency of their business and streamline operations
                    from managing ingredient usage and production costs to integrating their retail offering. They also needed a
                    way to protect their brand by ensuring every customer enjoys the same quality from every purchase.

                <p class="pb-3"><b>The Solution</b><br>Stewart & Jasper turned to RKL eSolutions to advise on the appropriate solution to meet their
                    needs. Sage Business Cloud Enterprise Management offered the functionality and tools they required to
                    address the challenges they had identified.</p>
                <p class="pb-3">
                    In addition to hulling, shelling and processing almonds, S&J produces gift baskets. Enterprise Management
                    helped integrate their retail operations allowing their POS system to send data directly into the Sage ERP
                    solution, helping to streamline business operations.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-3">As a process manufacturer using Enterprise Management, S&J utilizes recipes to manage
                    ingredient usage and production costs. Recipes are used to track the quantity requirements and costs of
                    individual items, such as bulk almonds, flavorings, and sugar per batch and lot. Enterprise Management also
                    gave S&J the ability to forecast ingredient requirements and production planning for each final product to
                    meet its growing demand.</p>
                <p class="pb-3">Using lot tracking functionality within Enterprise Management, S&J can now track the shelf life
                    for each product and also be better prepared should a product recall occur. Both combining to ensure a
                    consistent customer experience.</p>

                    traceability and production controls that their current Sage 100cloud solution could not offer. To resolve
                    the situation, Stewart & Jasper turned to its trusted partner, RKL eSolutions to manage its migration to
                    Sage Business Cloud Enterprise Management. The confidence of RKL staff to deliver a successful project,
                    combined with mastery of the Sage portfolio and industry expertise, eased the decision for S&J to commit to
